          Music
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have been playing for guitar for 21 years and toured the UK with my previous band Near Mrs. I enjoy a lot of different
          genres of guitar, most notably for me is the fusion of rock, funk and jazz that is perfectly mixed by my favourite guitarist, Guthrie Govan 😎

          Video Games
        </h2>
        <p>
          Like many, I enjoy playing video games in my spare time. I am a particular fan of the Dark Souls series and like to earn
          platinum trophies in my favorite games 🏆 I have been recently preparing myself for the Elden Ring DLC this weekend, and outside of this play
          Rocket League, Call of Duty and Trackmania pretty competitively 🏅

        <h2>
          Skateboarding
        </h2>
        <p>
          Another activity i really enjoy is skateboarding. I skate with my girlfriend locally but have also skated parks abroad such as the Santa Cruz park in Tenerife.
          I think that skateboarding is extremely challenging to start as a hobby and you often do not see progress for years, but for that i believe it is one of the best and most
          cathartic hobbies to pick up 🛹
